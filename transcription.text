 It's very, it's really great to meet you. I understand you're doing a start up. Yeah, so we're going to build in the future for a... Okay. So it's true. The future of office chairs. So what is the problem that you are solving? So most of us sitting in office for about eight hours a day, right? Have you ever noticed that you get back pain in the end of the day? So we're coming in, we're targeting him in middle. Do you think we can reinvent the chair? And that's why I'm making the chair inside your trousers. Wow, that's an amazing idea. Are you doing this alone? No, so it's my team of me in 12 other co-founders and all 12 of us went to Harvard Business School, Oxford, Cambridge and MIT. It's amazing. And how has the market treated you? Do you have existing customers? Sure, so right now we're sevens military, seven the UK and US military. And that's because our soldiers that are at war right now need places to sit in the resting. But obviously carrying chairs with them as well as their guns and their weapons won't be very viable. So we've basically embedded it within their common trousers. So I understand that the chair market in itself is very large. But not every chair can be replaced by this. How large is the market that you're going after with this new chair technology? Sure, so I mean the market that we've already hit is the UK and the US military, which has over a million people in it. But we think that we can tell you every single office worker and trust me there's a lot around the world. And so how big is that market in dollars? So we've calculated to be about $2.4 billion just in the consumer chair market. But then it gets into professional chairs. There's a lot of people who need it for surgery, for example, like surgeons, barbers and like they need some special extra chairs. It seems like it's honestly kind of an obvious idea. So is there any proprietary technology you're using to build this? To be honest, I think the whole notion of exoskeleton has been quite useful. So what Texas Instruments have been working on and Boston Labs, they've helped us a lot. So while I was at MIT, they really helped us getting the exoskeleton in the trousers. But we've used nanotechnology to basically embed it within the thread. And so you can wear trousers and people will look at my French. But if I'm not noticed that there's anything there, but then suddenly you'll be sitting in the air. There'll be so confused, but that's our technology. Amazing. Samir has been great to meet you.
